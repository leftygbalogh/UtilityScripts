Lockout with a script that runs from /etc/profile.d

I have found a very creative way to render a machine completely useless on my journey to bash wisdom. Practically, I ask for user credentials and if I get them, I issue an exit 0 that terminates my ssh connection, if I don't get them, I run the script again.

What does not kill the script - any number of:
CTRL+d
CTRL+c

Tried a few noninteractive shells and ways to get in: scp and rsync fail with timeout.

Emergency recovery does not seem to cure it either.

Any other way I could try and get in to modify or delete my script?

The killer script - for the record looks like this:

#!/bin/bash

dialog --inputbox "Enter your name:\n" 8 40 2>/var/lib/bla/name;
dialog --inputbox "Enter your email address:\n" 8 40 2>/var/lib/bla/email;

if [ -s /var/lib/bla/name ] && [ -s /var/lib/bla/email ]; then
    echo "Awesome."
    exit 0

else
    /etc/profile.d/credentials.sh
fi
